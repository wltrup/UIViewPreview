# UIViewPreview

## What

**UIViewPreview** is a Swift Package Manager package for iOS 13.0 and above, tvOS 13.0 and above, watchOS 6.0 and above, and macOS 10.15 and above, that enables *UIKit* development on *macOS Catalina* to take advantage of SwiftUI previews in Xcode 11 and above. It's entirely *not* my idea but, rather, just a wrapper for the [code written by matt, of NSHipster fame](https://nshipster.com/swiftui-previews/). In fact, that very article is the best source of information on how to use this package.

## Installation

**UIViewPreview** is provided only as a Swift Package Manager package, because I'm moving away from CocoaPods and Carthage, and can be easily installed directly from Xcode.
